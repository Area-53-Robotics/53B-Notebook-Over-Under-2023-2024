    When the game, “Over Under”, was first announced I thought that it would follow Vex’s usual cycle of games, meaning that the game will involve stacking. However, now I think that the robot will have to do more with moving through obstacles efficiently.

    Given the name of the game, I think this game would involve stacking of some form. I think we will have to stack things over others, and maybe have to put objects under platforms. I think the game objects will have cubes, similar to the ones from Tower Takeover.

    Considering that we haven't had a stacking game since Tower Takeover, I predict that we will be getting some sort of a stacking game. I think we need to construct a bot that will stack things over a hill like a King of the Hill. Lastly, the bot needs to park under something.

    When I heard ”Over Under” I guessed that we would have to either maneuver over obstacles or move game objects under and over a bar.  I thought we would have to focus on the size of the robot because there would probably be a lot of obstacles.

    When I heard the name “Over Under” I thought of a game involving moving blocks. I believe that this season will result in a game where we have to move our bot over obstacles. We might also need to move objects into slots.

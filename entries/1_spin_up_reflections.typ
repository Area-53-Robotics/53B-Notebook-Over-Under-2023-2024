We have found the best way to learn is by talking to other teams about their successes and innovations throughout the year with other teams that are not from the same region that we are from - as each region has their meta or speciality. But, since we didnâ€™t qualify for worlds this could only happen at US Open which

Last season there was a concern regarding the lack of designing and planning in the club. The coaches noticed that the team was building robots blindly and recommended spending some independent time creating CADs before starting to build. The benefit of creating a CAD design for a drive-train before attempting to physically create it is that it allows for freely changing the spacing of the gears to get it correct and as compact as possible. Below is a prototype of a 6 motor drive, which the team might plan to recreate. The drivetrain uses a 3:5 ratio, 3 '25 omni wheels, and an RPM of 360.

Last season, we realized the importance of consistent and sufficient practice for our driver to perform at their best. While we faced challenges in tournaments due to inadequate practice time, we have learned from this and are taking a new approach this season. As the current driver, I have prioritized practicing fundamental skills, such as maneuvering around obstacle courses, to improve my driving abilities. By tracking my progress and regularly practicing, I am confident that I will be able to compete at a higher level and contribute to the team's success in this season.

        Computer-aided design, commonly referred to as _CAD_ is the process of creating a design with computer software. This allows an engineer to visualize and simulate their design without spending resources to build a prototype. Last year, we did not utilize CAD in our design process, which often meant that many of our designs never worked, causing a lot of delays. This year however, Jin decided to take the initiative and learned how to design a robot using Onshape, a popular web-based CAD platform.

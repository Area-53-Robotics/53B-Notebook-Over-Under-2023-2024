After the reveal was released, I instantly thought of the importance of a small drivetrain, i.e 25-30 holes long, this is so that you can easily maneuver under the objects even if someone were to block the path. To add on to the drivetrain, I think it's important to be able to drive over the middle bar, so 4-inch wheels should be used this season. As for the RPM of the drivetrain, I think it should be circa 350 rpm. Also, the fact that there are more game objects that are match load-ins it is important to fastly place and shoot from the match load area.  The way I think this is possible is by using a puncher that will be ratcheted to the intake for fast cycle times. For the endgame phase of the match, I think a piston that attaches to the pole and a motor connected to wheels to move up the bar will  maximize points. Another good idea I thought of could be to pick up your alliance and carry them, since the points are relative to the highest point. Also, the new introduction of the watt limit is interesting.

After watching the reveal, I immediately thought of a bot that would push the acorns into the back of the goal. This robot would have a puncher to do that, and that would also be able to launch the acorns to the other side of the field. I also thought about making a piston that would lift the front wheels which would allow us to go over the three inch pipe in the middle. Overall, my first impressions of this game are rather positive, and I think that it looks like fun.

Something in the video that surprised me was the hanging aspect of the game. Never have I thought we would need to make a robot capable of holding onto a bar. One of the biggest concerns was what will happen after the game is over and all the motors go into coast mode. My idea for this problem is to make a 4 bar which I believe could be strong enough to hold the weight of the bot. We would open the clamp with motors, so when the motor dies at the end of the game, we will remain hanging.

When I watched the video I was intrigued with the grabbing aspect of the game because it would lead to a lot of different methods of picking up the acorns . Some ideas I had that are pretty interesting are a claw bot which would have a lot of maneuverability or a bot that scoops up the triballs and punches them into the goals. As a new driver this game seems harder than last year's Spin Up since it seems to focus on more of a skill oriented driving style instead of an aggressive

After watching the reveal I was surprised to learn about the pole-climbing aspect of the game. A problem we may need to focus on is how to get the bot off the pole safely. We could make something that clamps onto the pole using motors to “drive” up the pole. Overall, I believe this will be an interesting season allowing for creative/innovative ideas.

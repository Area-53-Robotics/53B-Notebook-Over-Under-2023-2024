      First we began with maintenance on the robot. This started with changing the lexan on our intake because it had snapped and needed a replacement. Also reattaching the catapult we took off to fix yesterday.

      Next, we focused on driver practice with Imaad going around the field and practicing regular driver functions like intaking, scoring, and shooting triballs across the center barrier. 

      Lastly, we did some auton practice. We used LemLib which uses the inertial sensor and wheel size to create PID and a position system. We have made the starter programs for our auton.

      Today was the scrim held by our team. We had four qualification matches and ended 2nd place out of the six teams present. During these qualifications we found that we should probably get an auton, figure out how to place the triball in the same place every time, and maximize the distance we can launch the triballs. For the elimination alliance, we got chosen by 53F but we rejected and then made an alliance with 53E. For our first elimination match we went against 53D and the guest team. Here we would figure out how rigorous defense can be and we would result in losing, this was because 53D got under us and we got stuck in the corner of the field. Something that we noticed is that if we had played more aggressively and pushed more acorns into our side than we would have won instead of playing defensively since our alliance's battery fell out and we had no one scoring. We had also realized that our motors were not protected enough on the bottom of the bot since 53D being under us had potential to really mess up our motors. We added a crossbar in the mid section of the bottom of our bot in order to protect our motors from being so easily accessed.
